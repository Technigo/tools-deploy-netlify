Netlify is a tool that offers hosting for webpages and continious deployment from Github. Meaning it provides your with a url and hosts your files on a webserver so that you and others can access them online.

✅Choose the repository that you would like to deploy. If you can't find the repository that you are looking for you might have to click the button `Configure Netlify on Github` 

✅Under Deploy settings you can choose which bransch you would like to deploy. If you haven't made any specific production bransch or similar, just go with ```master```. 

✅Click `Deploy site`. 

Wait a couple of minutes and your site will be deployed. Once fully deployed ***your sites url will show up on the overview page.*** This can for example be: https://infallible-hopper-12a82b.netlify.com.
